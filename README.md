# NetMonX
NetMonX is a personal home lab project designed to simulate an enterprise network environment using open-source tools. This project helped me bridge the gap between software and network engineering by practicing real-world skills in network segmentation, traffic analysis, firewall configuration, VPN deployment, and high availability simulation.
